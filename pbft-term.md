# PBFTTerm
> PBFT based algorithm, perfroms a single block_height consensus.

## Design notes
* PREPARE and COMMIT messages are broadcasted to all nodes.
* The sync flow is performed outside the scope of the OneHeight PBFT
* View Change message sent by a prepared node includes the candidate block
  * May add a request / response message as optimization
* New View includes all the view change proofs and a signed NV_PRE_PREPARE
  * May add an optimization to avoid n^2 signatures in new view
* A block can be committed (Commit_locally) even if not in Prepared state. (The block was received in PRE_PREPARE or NV_PRE_PREPARE).
* COMMIT messages of earlier views are accepted.
* Timer is attached to view, to ensure reset once per view (NEW_VIEW and TIME_OUT).
* Once "Stopped" OneHeight PBFT will not process any events.

## Messages
* PRE_PREPARE - sent by the leader
* PREPARE - sent by the validators
* COMMIT - sent by all nodes, incldues also the random seed signature.
* VIEW_CHANGE - sent upon timeout to the next leader candidate
* NEW_VIEW - sent by the newly elected leader.


## Databases

#### Messages Log
> Stores the current block_height messages that were accepted.
* Accessed by (View, Sender, Message_type)
* Persistent

#### State
> Stores the current block_height state variables.
* Persistent

* State variables:
  * Block_height (Term)
  * View
  * Candidate_block
  * Candidate_block_hash
  * Prepared_proof 
    * Block_Height
    * View
    * Block_hash

&nbsp;
## `PerformConsensus(block_height, ordered_nodes_list)`
* Init the state:
  * Clear stopped
  * Clear Messages Log
  * my_state.View = 0
  * my_state.Candidate_block = {}
  * my_state.Prepared_proof = {}
  * my_state.Prepared_block = {} 
  * my_state.NewView_locally = -1
  * my_state.Committed_locally = False  
  * trigger once, prepared, elected, new-view, committed.

#### Determine if leader
* Determine the current leader using `GetCurrentLeader`.

#### `PerformConsensus - Leader Only`
* Request new candidate block by calling `ConsensusAlgo.RequestNewBlock`
* Calculate the candidate_block_hash, by calling `ConsensusAlgo.CalcBlockHash`
* Generate PRE_PREPARE message and broadcast to all nodes
  * Type = PRE_PREPARE
  * Sender = Node public key
  * View = my_state.View
  * Block_height = my_state.Block_height
  * Block = candidate_block
  * Block_hash = candidate_block_hash
  * Signature {Type, Block_height, View, Block_hash}
* Update the state and log
  * Log the PRE_PREPARE message
  * Candidate_block_hash = PRE_PREPARE message.Block_hash
  * Candidate_block = PRE_PREPARE message.Block

#### `PerformConsensus - All nodes`
* Set timer with configurable base_round_timeout and my_state.View (timeout = base_round_timeout*2^view).
